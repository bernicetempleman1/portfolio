              <h2>Tell me about yourself.</h2>

              <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the first paragraph below to answer tell me about yourself -->
              <p>
                Thank you for asking. I am a collaborative and solution-driven
                software developer with over five years of experience working
                with engineers, developers, and programmers. I have a degree in
                Computer Science from Youngstown State University and a Master
                of Science in Computer Information Systems from the Florida
                Institute of Technology.
              </p>

              <p>
                I've already contributed to several projects and assisted with
                managing a project for one organization.
              </p>

              <p>
                Something I've enjoyed and have been able to use in my role as a
                developer is leveraging my experience in tech support and system
                administration to help identify and resolve complex issues.
              </p>

              <p>
                I worked on several projects using Java, JavaScript, HTML, C++,
                TypeScript, Visual Basic, MySQL, and Fortran.
              </p>

              <p>
                Since my latest role asked for Web Development, I signed up and
                started an online web development degree to increase my
                knowledge as quickly as possible.
              </p>

              <p>
                My experience has allowed me to sharpen my attention to detail
                and critical thinking skills and enhance my communication skills
                working on team-based projects and with clients.
              </p>

              <p>
                My latest technical role as a ServiceNow administrator and
                developer expanded my skills to a cloud platform to deliver
                client solutions.
              </p>

              <p>
                In my role in tech support, I received several commendations
                from customers where I could identify and resolve their
                technical issues with clarity and ease.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm excited to collaborate on a team, apply my technical skills
                to develop applications and systems and contribute to your team
                in a way that positively impacts the organization and your
                clients.
              </p>
